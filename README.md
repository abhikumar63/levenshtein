# Levenshtein Distance Calculator (C++)

![Levenshtein Distance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Levenshtein-Distance-blue)

A C++ implementation for calculating the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

The Levenshtein distance, also known as edit distance, is a measure of similarity between two strings by calculating the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

This repository provides a simple and efficient implementation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm along with examples demonstrating its usage.

## Features

- Calculates Levenshtein distance between two strings
- Efficient implementation with dynamic programming
- Easy-to-understand C++ code

## Usage

To calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings, include the `levenshtein_distance.h` header file in your C++ project and use the `calculateDistance` function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "levenshtein_distance.h"

int main() {
    std::string str1 = "kitten";
    std::string str2 = "sitting";

    int distance = calculateDistance(str1, str2);
    std::cout << "Levenshtein distance between '" << str1 << "' and '" << str2 << "' is: " << distance << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Example

Let's calculate the Levenshtein distance between "kitten" and "sitting":

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "levenshtein_distance.h"

int main() {
    std::string str1 = "kitten";
    std::string str2 = "sitting";

    int distance = calculateDistance(str1, str2);
    std::cout << "Levenshtein distance between '" << str1 << "' and '" << str2 << "' is: " << distance << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Levenshtein distance between 'kitten' and 'sitting' is: 3
```

## Installation

You can clone the repository or download the `levenshtein_distance.h` header file and include it in your C++ project. No external dependencies are required.
